# PROJECT: SIGNUP FORM

This is my implementation of the Odin Project's signup form for an imaginary service, the idea for this project is to use the intermediate level skills learnt in CSS and HTML to style a form which is possibly the most painful thing to style for when it comes to CSS.

## Topics learnt before starting the project

1. CSS variables
2. Frameworks ( Bootstrap, Tailwind )
3. Preprocessors
4. Advanced HTML ( for forms and tables )
5. Styling form components
6. Resets and default browser styles
7. Cross-compatibility across browsers.


**This is a work in progress: more to be added at a later stage**
